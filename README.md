### Quest 1
## Company research:

A company did a market research to find out if the consumers liked their latest product or not. They collected the interviewee's gender and his answer (yes or no). Knowing that 150 people were interviewed, make an algorithm that calculates and shows:
* The number of people who answered yes;
* The number of people who answered no;
* The percentage of women who answered yes;
* The percentage of male who answered no;

### Quest 2
## Electric company

For each of the electricity consumers in a city, the account number and the total KW consumed in the month are informed. Knowing that the cost of the each KW is R $ 1.75, make an algorithm to:
* Store and list the account number, the total KW consumed and the how much to pay for each registered consumer;
* List the account number, the total KW consumed and the amount to be paied by the consumer who spent the most and least spent;
* Show the average consumption of the city;
* Show the number of consumers that exceeded 170 KW;
Store information in vector and/or matrix structures. On the screen should be a MENU for the user to register a new account or to view the above informations

## Magic square

> _"A magic square is a square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range, 
>such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal." (wikipedia)_   
* Given a matrix with the dimension DxD, check if the square is magic or not using an algorithm.

### Quest 4
## Magic square  

Write a function that takes two strings as parameters, as well as an integer value that represents a position. 
The function must insert the second string at the indicated position of the first one and it should display the user's result.
